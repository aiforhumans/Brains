Memory Stats Dashboard ‚Äî See what your Smart Memory has learned

A beginner-friendly wrapper for BrainsXDEV_PromptBrainPerformanceDirect that shows
learning progress in an easy-to-read format.

How it works:
1. Connect your Smart Memory
2. Get a beautiful dashboard showing:
   - How many prompts you've rated
   - What art styles you prefer
   - Learning progress over time
   - Quality score trends

Example workflow:
- Smart Memory Loader ‚Üí Memory Stats Dashboard ‚Üí stats report
- Check progress after rating batches of prompts
- See which styles you rate highest
